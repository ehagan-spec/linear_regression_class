# AI Tools Disclaimer

## Purpose

This document outlines some policies and practices for responsible AI use in research.

## Philosophy

AI tools can be incredibly useful when writing code. They can also be leveraged to enhance productivity, but they must also be used in a responsible, mindful and ethnical manner. 
In code, they can steer analysis in strange directions, oftentimes AI code -- because of how the user relies on it --
is piecemeal and hard to follow. And, in statistics, AI have yet to match the caliber, depth and nuance in human 
generated content.

AI tools **may be used** for:

### Learning and Exploration
- AI can save a lot of time when it is used for debugging code and demystifying error messages
- Exploring alternative approaches to solving problems, and constructing alternative data pipelines
- Learning new R functions or tidyverse and related R syntax
- Generating example code to understand concepts
- Formatting and documenting code, as well as writing concise, readable code.

### Productivity
- AI tools may be used for autocompleting repetitive code patterns
- AI tools may be used to create templates (e.g., Github or function templates) by generating boilerplate code structure
- AI tools may be used to enahance code readability
- AI tools may be used to assist in writing documentation and code comments


1. **Understand the Code**: Please never submit code you don't understand. If you use AI in code completion, for instance, you *should* take
time to understand every line of code. 

2. **Verify Outputs**: Your calculations should be your own. Please do not use AI to entirely analyze data. 

3. **Cite AI Usage**: When submitting assignments, include a brief statement about how AI was used. Transparency
is important. 

4. **Test Thoroughly**: AI generated code often includes errors, and may not operate as intended, particularly with 
particular data structures.

5. **Document Your Understanding**: Intepretation and reporting should always be your own. Generative AI should not
be used to summarize results or draft interpretations of results. 

## Prohibited Uses

AI use *may not be used* for the following and will be reported.

1. **Generating solutions** without understanding
2. **Bypassing learning objectives** by having AI draft analysis and writing of your conceptual work
3. **Plagiarism** - Please report AI use. Failing to do so may be construed as a case of plagiarism.
4. **Exam/quiz assistance** is prohibited. In examinations, AI tools are prohibited from use.
5. **Generating made up data or results**.
